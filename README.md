# Readable Stream Playground for ESS Neutron Data 🚀💾  

This repository serves as a sandbox for testing **Readable Streams** in JavaScript. It focuses on handling data from the **ESS Neutron Data Source**, specifically for use in the **DMSC (Data Management and Software Center)** at the **European Spallation Source (ESS)**.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Readable Stream Testing**: Experiment with JavaScript streams for handling large datasets.  
- **ESS Neutron Data Integration**: Simulate and process neutron data from ESS.  
- **Customizable Stream Handling**: Modify and test stream behaviors for various data scenarios.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- **Node.js** (14+ recommended).  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/readable-stream-playground.git  
cd readable-stream-playground  

2. Install dependencies:  
npm install  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. **Run the Playground**:  
   Start the script to test readable streams:  
   node stream_test.js  

2. **Simulate ESS Data**:  
   Modify `ess_data_simulator.js` to generate custom neutron data streams for testing.  

3. **Customize Stream Handling**:  
   Edit `stream_test.js` to experiment with different stream operations such as filtering, transforming, or aggregating data.  

---

## File Structure 📂  

- `stream_test.js`: Main script for testing readable streams.  
- `ess_data_simulator.js`: Simulates neutron data for testing purposes.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## Example Commands  

- Start the Stream Test:  
  node stream_test.js  

- Simulate Neutron Data:  
  node ess_data_simulator.js
